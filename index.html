        <div class="copy">
          <p>I grew up in Chai Wan, a beautiful suburban area located in the city of Hong Kong. </p>
        
          <P>Growing up, I have always admired the western education system where personal development is as equally important as academic achievement. Therefore, at the age of 16, I decided to move to Seattle, Washington to continue my higher education.</P>
      
          <p>Over a course of 5 years in 3 different cities (Seattle, Houston, Austin), I am now a College Graduate from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Kinesiology and Health since Spring 2019.</p>
      
          <p>My past is an example I set for myself that dreams can beceome reality with determination, persistance, and consistent self-love. I am now continuing my journey of self improvement by looking for a full-time job opportunity.</p>

            <p>Senior year of college, I took my first social dance class at UT Austin with Nick and Mellisa Enge and fell in love with social dance ever since. I am experienced in multiple dance styles (Swing, Waltz, Salsa, Bachata, Country, West Coast). My favorite dance style is country two-step and my favorite dance hall is the White Horse in downtown Austin.</p>
            <p>Being a part of the Austin AcroYoga community have taught me that there are endless possibilities and the limitation I set for myself is often unrealistic. I have successfully mastered headstands after 21 years.</p>
